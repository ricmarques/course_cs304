title: "CS304: Compilers"
course_description: "A detailed introduction to programming language translation, including the functions and general organization of compiler design and interpreters. Focuses on the study of syntax, semantics, ambiguities, procedures replication, iteration, and recursion in these languages."

**Unit 11: Compiler Summary and Next Steps** <span id="11"></span> 
*This unit concludes our course study of compilers. * *We summarize the
topics we have studied in the course and look ahead to further study to
build upon what we have learned in this course.  The topics covered may
at first seem limited in their application to the development of
compilers.  However, their application is much broader, and helps us
write better programs.  The techniques, abstractions, and data
structures are applicable to many other applications, including safety,
security, high-performance applications, data and control flow analysis,
internal or intermediate representation and encoding of structures, and
optimization for external dependencies.*

**Unit 11 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 3 hours to complete.
